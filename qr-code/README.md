# Frontend Mentor - QR code component

## My Attempt at recreating this QR code component Challenge

This is my first challenge from FrontendMentor.io.

There were a few things I needed to lookup because I ran into a couple things which weren't working correctly until I found an answer and fixed them.  I did add a little extra feature which slightly scales up the qr card when hovered to make it stand out a little.

One thing that took a bit was the image size not keeping the correct margin.  I got this to work by starting fresh today and putting it in another container with its own margin (see .qr-container).

I still could not get the font to work for some reason.  It did work but the font that was recommended did not match the text in the sample image, so I went with something close.

I left a few of the CSS element properties commented out so you could see some of what I was originally thinking.  Some of them worked great when the browser was maximized but did not scale correctly when the browser window size was changed.

I still did not attempt to get the sizes correct for what was asked for.  I did not scale it for the 1440px desktop OR the mobile version.  I will work on that in the future but didn't want to delay what I had already based on that being missed.

Also the background image I didn't know where to find so I left that off as well.

## Feedback or Suggestions?

Please feel free to take a look and suggest any tips.  I am refreshing my HTML / CSS skills after many years of not using them.

I know there is much to learn and I am looking forward to improving my skills and completing more challenges.
